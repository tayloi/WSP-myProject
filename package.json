  "description": "My personal project for Web Server Programming\r # About Me\r My name is Imani Taylor. I am a junior at New Paltz studying Computer Science. I actually just transferred here last semester from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). At RPI, I majored in Computer and Systems Engineering and switched to Information Technology and Web Science during my last semester there. Prior to that, I first got my start in programming in high school through a summer program called Girls Who Code, where I learned Scratch, Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. Between RPI and New Paltz, I have taken the following computer-related courses: Computer Science 1, Data Structures, Intro to ECSE, Foundations of Computer Science, Computer Components and Operations, Embedded Control, Intro to ITWS, Web Systems Development, Object Oriented Programming, and Assembly Language and Computer Architecture. In Intro to ITWS, I worked with a group to develop a web application that allows professors to better keep track of attendance for various classes using time sensitive electronic codes as opposed to calling out names or having students sign or check next to their names on paper. In Web Systems Development, I worked with a group to create a website where users can go and create and/or answer survey questions on virtually any topic as long as they are approved by an admin.",
